# 1. AVL trees #

They got the name by the initial letters of their authors' names. The AVL tree is a binary tree of search, for which, for each node in the tree, the absolute value of the difference in the height of the left and right subtree is less than or equal to 1. AVL trees are the first data structure that guarantees that the complexity of any of the basic operations with the data structure (adding a new element,
Â  deletion, search) is not greater than log (n) where n is the number of elements in the tree. The basic idea is that after each operation, an additional effort is made to keep the tree balanced so that the height of the tree is always log (n).
